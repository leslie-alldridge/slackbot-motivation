# slackbot-motivation

My goal is to learn how Slack Bots are built and the API communication between Slack and a Web App. 

I see glum faces at work and I hope this application is a way to help everyone keep their heads high and a smile on their dial. We work at Xero! We're all so lucky!

## Personal Reflections
Wow, I've learned a lot today. I feel as though Slack Bots were the complete unknown to me at lunch time, but looking back after investing three hours this evening, it's now known. 

I managed to catch some staff that were still working and asked them to test it out for me, provide feedback and any feature requests they had. It was awesome to do this early on, so I could maintain focus and steer the product down the right path. 

I'm excited to present this to my boss tomorrow, learn more about Slack integrations (bots) and add more quotes to it as time goes on. 

Deploying on the free plan to Heroku will present time out errors, I'm unsure how to handle those yet...but I'm thinking if there's enough demand company wide I'll pay the $7 for the upgraded plan to gain 24/7 uptime.
